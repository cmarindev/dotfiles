# My Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles repository! üéâ

This is a collection of my personal configurations and settings for various tools, editors, and shell environments that I use on a daily basis. It includes:

- [**i3wm**](https://i3wm.org/): A dynamic tiling window manager for X11, perfect for those who prefer keyboard-driven workflows and a lightweight, flexible desktop environment.
- [**Picom**](https://github.com/yshui/picom): A compositor for X11, providing effects such as transparency, shadows, and smooth animations to enhance the visual experience of the desktop.
- [**Polybar**](https://github.com/polybar/polybar): A fast and easy-to-configure status bar for X11, displaying system information like time, battery, network status, and more, with a clean and minimalistic design.
- [**Neovim**](https://neovim.io/): A modern, extensible text editor built to improve productivity for developers and power users, with a focus on efficiency and extensibility. My configuration includes several plugins and customizations to optimize the editing experience.
- [**Rofi**](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi): A lightweight, highly configurable application launcher and window switcher for X11, ideal for quickly accessing programs, running commands, or switching between open windows.  
  Rofi integrates seamlessly into minimalistic setups, offering speed and versatility while maintaining a clean and unobtrusive design.
